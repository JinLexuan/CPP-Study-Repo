# Virtual Destructor
Useful when dealing with polymorphism. Prevent memory leakage.  
Try the following code with or without virtual for the Base destructor.
``` cpp
class Base
{
public:
    Base() {std::cout << "Base Constructor\n";}
    virtual ~Base() {std::cout << "Base Destructor\n";}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {std::cout << "Derived Constructor\n";}
    ~Derived() {std::cout << "Derived Destructor\n";}
};

int main()
{
    Base* base = new Base();
    delete base;
    
    std::cout << "----------------------\n";
    
    Derived* derived = new Derived();
    delete derived;
    
    std::cout << "----------------------\n";
    // If the destructor of Base is not set as virtual,
    // poly will not call the destructor of Derived when deleted.
    Base* poly = new Derived();
    delete poly;
}
```

# Casting
1. static_cast: perform "natural" and low-risk conversions, such as conversions between integers and float types, and between character types. It cannot be used for casts of pointer types.
2. reinterpret_cast: mandatory cast between various types of pointers reinterpret. memory to something else. 
3. const_cast: add or remove const.  
4. dynamic_cast: does not check cast safety, only checks at runtime, returns null if no cast is possible.

``` cpp
double value = 5.25;
int a = (int)value + 5.3; // C style casting
int s = static_cast<int>(value) + 5.3; // Cpp style casting
```

``` cpp
class Base
{
public:
    Base() {}
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    Derived() {}
    ~Derived() {}
};

class AnotherClass : public Base
{
public:
    AnotherClass() {}
    ~AnotherClass() {}
};

int main()
{   
    Derived* derived = new Derived();
    Base* base = derived;
    
    AnotherClass* ac = dynamic_cast<AnotherClass*>(base);  // return nullptr
    Derived* der = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base);  // successful conversion
}
```
RTTI: Runtime Type Information

# Break Points

# Precompiled Header
Precompiled header: get a bunch of head files and convert them into compile format. Compiler can use them instead of reading those head files again and again.  
Do not put frequentlt changing head files into precompiled header.

# dynamic_cast
dynamic_cast: cast derived type to base type or base type to derived type.
``` cpp
class Entity
{
private:
    virtual void printName() {};  // To make class Entity polymorphic
};

class Player : public Entity
{
};

class Enemy : public Entity
{
};

int main()
{
    Player* player = new Player();
    Entity* actualEnemy = new Enemy();
    Entity* actualPlayer = player;
    
    Player* p0 = dynamic_cast<Player*>(actualPlayer);
    Player* p1 = dynamic_cast<Player*>(actualEnemy);  // return nullptr
}
```
C++ stores runtime type information(RTTI), including runtime information about types. Create extra cost.
RTTI can be enabled or disabled in visualstudio.
